                👋 Hello! I'm a second-year Computer Science student pursuing a B.Tech degree.<br />

                🖥️ I have a strong foundation in programming languages like C, HTML, SQL, Java, Python, and C++. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. My interests include data structures, algorithms, and software development methodologies.<br/>

                💡 Outside the classroom, I engage in extracurricular activities and projects. I participate in coding competitions, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate on hackathons to apply and refine my skills.<br/>

                🤝 I'm open to networking with fellow students, professionals, and mentors. Feel free to connect with me to explore opportunities to learn and grow together!
